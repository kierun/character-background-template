## Usage

Clone the repository, rename a few files, and start editing… More to come soon.

## Development

### Pre commit hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Please install it and use it.

```bash
pipx install gitlint                        # Or use pip, or whatever package management you have.
pipx install pre-commit                     # Or use pip, or whatever package management you have.
pre-commit install                          # Initialisation, not shocker there.
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg   # This is for gitlint!
pre-commit autoupdate                       # To update pre-commit hooks.
```

### CI/CD

… To be done soon.
