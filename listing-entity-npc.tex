    Edward Teach was a fierce pirate who roamed the seas around the West Indies and the east coast of Britain's North American colonies. He was famous for his daring raids, alliances, blockades, and attacks. He was captain of the Queen Anne's Revenge, armed with 40 guns and a crew of over 300 men. But his reign of terror came to an end after he was defeated by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard.
